Work in progress... *do not* release the Kraken.

### Notes

- New site setup with Asp.Net5 MVC6 RC1 Purple3 Monkey8 Dishwasher1.2
- Using Knockout 3.4 components to support a very simple structure
- Login via Octopus creds working... creates API key at login and stores per user
- CRUD operations of release batches in UI handled via [cmdrjs](https://github.com/cmdrjs) for now (shameless plug)
- Core logic still being ported and is not available yet making this fairly useless at the moment... sorry
